                <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is getting more and more popular, being adopted in a large number of applications and technologies we use on a daily basis. 
A large number of AI-enabled applications are produced by developers without proper training on software quality practices or processes, and in general, lack state-of-the-art software engineering processes. 
An AI-enabled system is a software-based system that comprises AI components besides traditional software components. As any software system, AI-enabled systems require attention to software quality assurance (SQA) in general and code quality in particular. 
Current development processes, and in particular agile development models, enable companies to decide on the technologies to adopt in their system in a later stage. Therefore, it is hard to anticipate if a system, or if a data pipeline used to develop AI will produce high-quality models. 
The main reason is due to the fact that the AI engineer profession was born very recently, and currently there is a very limited number of training or guidelines on issues (such as code quality or testing) for AI and applications using AI code. 
According to preliminary studies, developers' training is one of the biggest lacks in software quality assurance for AI, which usually brings several issues related to low quality of AI code as well as low long-term maintenance. Moreover, the software quality of AI-enabled system is often poorly tested and of very low quality.

                <!--<P>The assessment of software quality is one of the most multifaceted (e.g., structural quality, product quality, process quality, etc.) and subjective aspects of software engineering (since in many cases it is substantially based on expert judgement). Such assessments can be performed at almost all phases of software development (from project inception to maintenance) and at different levels of granularity (from source code to architecture). However, human judgement is: (a) inherently biased by implicit, subjective criteria applied in the evaluation process, and (b) its economical effectiveness is limited compared to automated or semi-automated approaches. To this end, researchers are still looking for new, more effective methods of assessing various qualitative characteristics of software systems and the related processes. In recent years we have been observing a rising interest in adopting various approaches to exploiting machine learning (ML) and automated decision-making processes in several areas of software engineering. These models and algorithms help to reduce effort and risk related to human judgment in favor of automated systems, which are able to make informed decisions based on available data and evaluated with objective criteria. Thus, the adoption of machine learning techniques seems to be one of the most promising ways to improve software quality evaluation. Conversely, learning capabilities are increasingly often embedded within software, including in critical domains such as automotive and health. This calls for the application of quality assurance techniques to ensure the reliable engineering of ML-based software systems.
