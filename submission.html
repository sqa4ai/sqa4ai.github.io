                    <p>The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from software quality and AI. As outcome, we would like to build up a community that will target the new challenges emerging in both domains creating synergies.</p>

                    Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
                        <ul style="margin-left: 1cm;"><li>Best practices and experiences on training non software engineering experts on quality assurance for AI</li>
                        <li>Software quality aspect related to integration of AI-based components</li>
                        <li>The relationship between software quality and system as well as data quality for AI-based systems</li>
                        <li>Techniques and tools on software quality for AI</li>
                    <li>Testing AI-based systems </li></ul>


<p>We expect workshop attendees will be people interested in understanding software quality practices for AI. To acquire a complete overview of problems, we will try to involve people with different background: experts in software quality and in AI. We will do so by inviting colleagues with experience and interest in the subject to participate to the workshop in various possible forms (giving keynotes, taking part to the panel and open discussion, participate in the papers evaluation process). 
Since the topic attractiveness is increasing among researchers and practitioners, we expected to have a good number of attendees and submitted papers. We believe to receive near 10 papers and 30 attendees. 
To ensure a wide dissemination of the event, we will build a workshop website containing general information about the workshop (topic, format, program committee, etc.). It will provide updates about the current status of the workshop. Moreover, we will create different social media accounts (e.g. Twitter) to corroborate the dissemination plan. </p>

<p>Moreover, we will build a targeted mailing list of possible participants by (a) involving people from both community domains and (b) by searching the literature to find authors expert and interested in the subject.
We will try to solicit participation from communities other than software engineering, to facilitate the integration of interdisciplinary research contributions. To this end, we will publicize the event on relevant mailing lists of the different communities. The members of the program committee cover different areas, communities, and nationalities and will be asked to solicit contributions.
The intended length of the workshop is one day. The preliminary program comprises three to four sessions, which will include keynotes by distinguished experts in the areas of research and industry, and the presentation of position papers. Each session (1.5 hour) will be planned so to guarantee enough time for questions and discussions. The whole workshop will be concluded by a panel discussion (30 to 60 minutes) to sum up the workshop findings and also to discuss open issues for joint future research.
Another important source for contributions to the workshop will be the program committee that will include well-respected researchers from various software engineering areas, from both research and academia, and from various geographical areas.
The workshop does not require special services or logistic, nor it has specific equipment constraints, but, if possible, a video registration of the various sessions would be very welcome. We are aware to support an hybrid version to guarantee researchers who cannot travel to USA to attend the workshop.
The workshop will accept full papers with a maximum length of 8 pages and will follow the full double-blind review process as recommended from SANER.
Each submitted paper will be reviewed by at least three PC members and will be assessed for their pertinence to the workshop theme, for the quality of the writing and for the level of interest that the expressed position could raise in the community.</p>

                  <!--  <p>The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss new ideas, trends and results concerning the application of machine learning methods for software engineering. The focus areas of the workshop are software quality assessment, practices that contribute towards quality assurance, and the application of software engineering techniques to self-learning systems. We expect that the workshop will help with:
                    <br>
                        1. The validation of existing machine learning methods for software quality assessment, as well as their application to novel contexts;<br>
                        2. The evaluation of machine learning methods compared to other automated approaches, as well as to human judgment;<br>
                        3. The adaptation of machine learning approaches already used in other areas of science in the context of software quality;<br>
                        4. The design of new techniques to validate software based on machine learning, inspired by traditional software engineering techniques;<br>
                        5. The introduction of approaches based on machine learning to support software engineering practices that contribute to quality assurance (e.g., patterns, refactoring, etc.).<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: <br>
                    - application of machine learning in software quality assessment; <br>
                    - supporting the application of software engineering practices through machine learning; <br>
                    - analysis of multi-source data; <br>
                    - knowledge acquisition from software repositories; <br>

<h3>Evaluation Criteria and Submission</h3>

<p>We are looking for two different types of papers:
<br>
    1.	<b>Technical papers</b>, where we invite to submit original research (even at early stages of evaluation) on how machine learning and software quality assurance can support each other. Papers must not exceed 6 pages for the main text, including figures, tables, appendices, and references. They will be part of the ESEC/FSE proceedings under the copyright of the ACM digital library.<br>
    2.	<b>Presentation abstracts</b> which will be up to 2 pages long and will report (i) research results that are either already published or ready to be submitted to software engineering conferences/journal and (ii) <b>industrial talks</b>. This new track aims at stimulating the participation of industrial practitioners - who will be able to present the practices used in their contexts - as well as researchers - who may be interested in receiving feedback from the research community on early ideas. They will only be reviewed for relevance, and will not be included in the MaLTeSQuE proceedings, but the abstracts will be made available on the website of the workshop.
